    <p>The accident rate due to negligence of observing traffic signs and not obeying traffic rules has been increasing drastically.
        By utilization of synthesized training data, which are created from road traffic sign images allows us to overcome the problems of
        traffic sign detection databases, which vary for countries and regions. This method is used for the generation of a database which
        consists of synthesized pictures to detect traffic signs under different view-light conditions. With this data set and a perfect
        Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we can develop a data driven, traffic sign recognition and detection system which has high
        detection accuracy and also has high performance ability in training and recognition processes. This ensures less occurrence of
        accidents and also helps the driver to concentrate on driving rather than observing each and every traffic sign. The purpose of this
        paper is to provide an efficient method for detection and recognition of traffic signs in India. We proposed methods like neural network
        and feature extraction which overcome the limitations of existing methods and improve the efficiency in detecting traffic signs and
        also reduce the road accidents</p>

    <p>A Netflix clone typically involves the use of technologies such as front-end frameworks like React or Vue. js for building the user interface, back-end frameworks like Node. js or Django for server-side logic, and a database system, often MongoDB or MySQL, to store user information and content details.</p>
